Veilr, a Flickr clone, is a social media application that allows professional photographer and photography enthusiasts to show off their work while enjoying the work of others. 

The name Veilr, comes from the word veil, a piece of fabric worn by bride to conceal the face. And the goal of my website is to help the user to remove and reveal any mystery behind the wedding photography industry.
